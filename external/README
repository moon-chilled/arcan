For some build-environments where you want tight control over which dependencies
that are linked statically / dynamically and how these libraries are configured,
some additional measures are needed.

On systems with the dependencies for [video/input platforms] fulfilled, the
only needed libraries should be openctm, gorilla audio (pulse|alsa|oss|openal),
freetype, sqlite3, and lua51 or luajit.

For freetype/luajit, there is a bash script in external/git/clone.sh that
clones the repositories needed for a static build. CMake will check for the
corresponding folders during configuration, and for the ones that are found,
the normal FindModule will be side-stepped.

Additionally, gorilla audio is always built from source, since it is not likely
to be packaged or available as a shared library.

To set up manually, just make sure that the following git mapping is correct:

http://luajit.org/git/luajit-2.0.git external/luajit
git://git.sv.nongnu.org/freetype/freetype2.git external/freetype
https://github.com/moon-chilled/gorilla-audio external/gorilla-audio

The download script also includes 'libuvc' for portable USB based video camera
support. This is not used unless explicitly built into the decode frameserver
as a build-time option (default=Off).
